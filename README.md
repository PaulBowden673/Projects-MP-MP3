**I built this website to give users a fun and enjoyable game to play. I based the game on Health & Safety questions so it can also be used for training**
## UX ##
**The purpose of this project is to create an Interactive Frontend Website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In order to do this I have built a Health & Safety Quiz game, where the users have to answer 20 questions about general Workplace Health & Safety**






**I incorporated the following things in order for the target audience to have a great experience when visiting my website,**

- A Home page with buttons to start the game and also view the game rules.
- A rules section so users can learn how to play the game.
- A highscores section so users can keep track of thier scores and complete against other users for the highest score.
- A Contact form so users can contact me with feedback via EmailJS.

## Testing
 I have thoroughly tested this website and was unable to find any broken links within it. I have also tried to submit blank contact forms and forms with incorrect email addresses which gave me an error message by way of alert box when thhe emial was sent.
 
 ### Testing User Stories from UX section

User stories from the UX section were tested to ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals. 

 #### First Time visitor

1. As a first time Visitor, I want to easily understand the purpose of the site and how to play the game.
    1. On entering the site, the user is presented with a clean website detailing the purpose of the site and giving instructions on how to play the game after clicking on the rules button.  
2. As a first time visitor, I want to find the game enjoyable and challenging.
    1. . On entering the website the user is presented with several buttons - Play, Rules, Highscores and Contact. THe user can then easily choose to play or to review the other options presented.
 
 #### Returning Visitor

1.  As a returning visitor, I want to still find the game enjoyable and challenging. 
    1.  The questions are displayed in a random order everytime the game is started.
2.  As a returning visitor, I want to be able to give feedback to the website owner and suggest improvements or ideas.
    1. The contact button takes the user from the home screen to blank email form for them to complete with name, email address and message. Upon clicking send email, the email is sent via EmailJS to the site owner.

#### Frequent Visitor

1. As a frequent visitor,  I want to still find the game enjoyable and challenging.
    1. The questions are presented in a random order everytime the game is played.
2. As a frequent visitor,  I want to be able to try to beat the highest scores.
    1. The user can display the current table of high scores ( the scores are only saved locally on the same device previously used)
3. As a frequent visitor, I want to be able to give feedback on the quiz.
    1. The contact button takes the user from the home screen to blank email form for them to complete with name, email address and message. Upon clicking send email, the email is sent via EmailJS to the site owner.

## Issues/Bugs

- The score was showing the previous game score rather than the current game score. After investigation, I identified that the issue was in the script.js file. Once the game had ended the score was set to the local storage. The finalScore variable was then set to get the score from the local storage, this was getting the wrong score. To resolve the issue, I put the finalScore variable in the function that increments the score during the quiz and set it to return that score.After testing this more the issue was resolved.

- During testing I identified an issue in the main Quiz Game section. In the script.js file, any correct or incorrect answers selected by the user would have the relevant style class applied to change the colour, once the answer was selected, the answer button did not change to the relevant colour, instead the surrounding area in between the buttons would have the style class applied to change the colour. I identified that the style class was being applied to the parent element of the answer button which is the div containing all the answer buttons. The style class was applied to the div rather than the answer buttons. To fix the issue, I changed the code in the script.js to ensure the style class is applied to the answer buttons. Further testing was completed, and the answer buttons now correctly have the style applied.

- An additional issue was identified within the main Quiz Game section. The answer buttons have a hover style applied, once the user selects the answer and the new class style is applied for correct or incorrect answer, the hover style was still in effect. if the user was still hovering over the answer button, they were not able to see whether the answer was correct or incorrect. This affected the UX of the quiz. To resolve the issue, I added additional style classes to separate the answer buttons from the other buttons. Then I added additional code in the script.js, when the user selects the answer the hover style would be removed from the button and the correct/incorrect style class applied. The hover style is now removed, and they are able to view whether the answer is correct or incorrect.

- During testing an issue was found with the finish quiz modal that pops up once user has finished the game. The default behaviour for a modal is to close if mouse is clicked outside of the modal or if 'esc' is pressed on keyboard. This was causing an issue as the user was able to close the finish quiz modal and return back to the quiz game section. However, they would not be able to view the finish quiz modal again, and all the progress would be lost. The only way to exit the game would be to reload the webpage or select the 'Quit Game' button and return to the Home page. This identified issue would reduce the UX and functionality of the end game section. To resolve this issue, I added additional code to the script.js for the finish quiz modal as well as confirmation modals. This has improved the overall UX of the quiz game. Once the user is presented with the finish quiz modal, they can no longer close this without selecting one of the provided buttons. The user is also not able to close the additional confirmation modal without selecting one of the options. 

- On mobile devices, a UX issue was identified with the hover style. Once the user clicked the button to select their answer, the answer would have the correct class applied to change colour. However, once the next question was presented the hover style was still applied to the last selected button. I moved the ans-btn:hover to a media query and this removed the highlighted question on mobile devices, but the answer text is changed to black. The issue is still present but not as noticable as it was previously.

## Deployment
### Local Deployment
To be able to run this project, the following tools have to be installed:
- An IDE  (I used [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) online IDE for creating this project)
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/) (for creation your database)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) 
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)   
#### Directions
1. You can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting the following command into the terminal:   
`git clone https://github.com/irinatu17/MyCookBook`    
Alternatively, you can save a copy of this repository by clicking the green button "Clone or download" , then "Download Zip" button, and after extract the Zip file to your folder.
2. In the terminal window change directory (CD) to the correct file location (directory that you have just created).
3. Set up environment variables:
    - Create **.env** file in the root directory.
    - On the top of the file add `import os` to set the environment variables in the operating system.
    - Set the connection to your MongoDB database(MONGO_URI) and a SECRET_KEY with the following syntax:
    `os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "YourSecretKey"`   
    `os.environ["MONGO_URI"] = "YourMongoURI"`  
    .
4. Install all requirements from the **requirements.txt** file putting this command into your terminal:   
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`  
*Note: GitPod does not require `sudo`, so if you use another IDE, you will need to include `sudo` in the beginning of the command: `sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.*
5. Create a new Database called "MyCookBook" in [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/).   
*You can sign up for free account, if you do not have one.*
6. In "MyCookBook" database create five following collections:
###### Cuisines
```
_id: <ObjectId>
cuisine_type: <String>
```
###### Meals
```
_id: <ObjectId>
meal_type: <String>
```
###### Diets
```
_id: <ObjectId>
diet_type: <String>
```
###### Users
```
_id: <ObjectId>
username: <String>
password: <String>
user_recipes: <Array>
```
###### Recipes
```
_id: <ObjectId>
recipe_name: <String>
description: <String>
cuisine_type: <String>
meal_type: <String>
cooking_time: <String>
diet_type: <String>
servings: <String>
ingredients: <Array>
directions: <Array>
author: <ObjectId>
image: <String>
```
7. You will now be able to run the application using the following command `python3 run.py`.   

### Heroku Deployment
To deploy the project to [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) the following steps need to be completed:
1. Create a **requirement.txt** file, which contains a list of the dependencies, using the following command in the terminal:  
`pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`
2. Create a **Procfile**, in order to tell Heroku how to run the project, using the following command in the terminal:   
`echo web: python run.py > Procfile`
3. `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` these files to GitHub repository
4. Create a **new app** in Heroku, assigning a name (must be unique) and set a region (for my project I set Europe)
5. From the Heroku dashboard link the new Heroku app to your GitHub repository:    
    - "Deploy" -> "Deployment method" -> "GitHub"
    - then "Enable automatic deployment"
6. To start the web process, put the following command into the terminal: `heroku ps:scale web=1` to scale dynos
7. In the **Settings** tab of the new Heroku app, click on "Reveal Config Vars" and set the following config vars:
    - **IP** : 0.0.0.0
    - **PORT** : 8080
    - **MONGO_URI** : `<link to your MongoDB database>`
    - **SECRET_KEY** : `<your secret key>`
    - **DEBUG**: **FALSE**  
*Note: your MONGO_URI and SECRET_KEY must match the ones you entered in .env.py file*

8. The app will be deployed and ready to run. Click "Open App" to view the app.   

**Note**: if you have not linked GitHub and Heroku following step N.5, alternatively as the last step of deployment, you can put the following command into your terminal:   
 `heroku login`, after a successful log in `git push heroku master` - to push the app to Heroku, and finally click "Open App" in Heroku dashboard to view the app.
